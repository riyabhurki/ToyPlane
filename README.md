## 🛠️ How It Was Built

1. **Folder Structure Setup** in Next.js with Tailwind CSS.
2. Added a **custom Hero and Feature section** using reusable React components.
3. Integrated **Three.js via `@react-three/fiber`** to load a 3D toy plane SVG (since `.glb` support caused issues).
4. Ensured **smooth UX and responsiveness** with Tailwind utilities.
5. Deployed locally and tested for mobile responsiveness and visual consistency.
